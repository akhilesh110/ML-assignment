 Yahoo News Searching and Text Analytics

This is a demo repo to demonstrate how to use Python [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) libraries to search and scrape result data. And save scraping results into [Pandas'](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframe.

Please remind that this analysis sample is for demonstration purposes only. In the real world, it is complex and requires multiple channels/dimensions analysis of statistical data together with possible related external factors data, including overall market, social, etc. Thatâ€™s really a Big Data and Advanced Analytics challenge in our everyday life. Crypto is still a relatively high-risk market to invest in. Please do deeper research before going to surf.ssignment
